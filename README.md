# html5-cli

Rapidly create an h5 boilerplate with everything out of the box.

## What HTML5 here means?

Here the html5-cli is mean to create `HTML5 projects`, which have the following characteristics:

* Usually need to be created in a hurry.

* Short-term (will be offline soon after being online).

* Usually have a nice look when compared to those long-term projects.

* Usually have only a little business logic in them.

Do you remember those projects you created for some holidays? Do you remember those projects you created to draw people's attention to your core products? Haha, I quite mean those projects here.
